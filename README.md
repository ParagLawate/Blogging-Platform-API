# Blogging-Platform-API

📖 Project Description

This project is a backend blogging application developed with Spring Boot.
It provides a RESTful API for managing blog posts and their categories.
The goal is to create a scalable and secure platform that can be used by a frontend (React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.) or consumed directly via tools like Postman.
